# mySearch - Core Project
This is a study project that uses open source libraries to index metadata and content from different document types in a Solr 5 server.

In the first runnable test version you can index docx metadata and text content into a running Solr server instance by executing:
java -jar http://localhost:8983/solr/yourCollection /path/to/docx
